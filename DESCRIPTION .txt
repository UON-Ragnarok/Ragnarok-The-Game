DESCRIPTION 


'Ragnar√∂k The Game' is a single player Shoot'em up (also known as shmup or STG).


In the year XXXX, humans have started a revolt against the gods of Asgard. You are one of the last space combatants available to defeat Asgard.

In a spacecraft, you will travel across the universe, facing the sworn protectors of Asgard, indestructible meteors and the mighty defender of Asgard... Thor(sten) himself.

Control the spacecraft using your mouse or trackpad to doge enemies or shoot them down. But remember, meteorites are indestructible so avoid them at all cost. 

You will earn points by destroying the enemy and you will earn 100 points by destroying the mighty Thor.  

However, powered by the power of Odin and their thirst to serve their home, the protectors will get stronger and faster each time you defeat Thor. 

Upon destroying an enemy, there is a small chance that a portion of the power of Odin will drop. If you collect it, it can either boost your power or increase your shooting speed permanently or allow you to double shoot for 10 seconds. 

That is all the information we have, good luck soldier!
